      <h2>Welcome to my personal Website!</h2>
      <p>My name is James and I am an IT systems engineer with 3 years of experience in designing, implementing, and maintaining complex IT systems.  </p>
	  <p>My passion for technology started at a young age and has only grown stronger as my career progresses. </p>
	  <p>I love to solve complex problems and puzzles. Recently, I've been into Sudoku. My best expert time (no hints/mistakes) is around 5 minutes. </p>
	  <p>Throughout my professional journey, I have developed my technical skills in areas such as network infrastructure, systems administration, cloud computing, cybersecurity, and project management. </p>
	  <p>However, I created this page more for fun than to show off my skills. If you want to know more about those, please reach out via linkedin. </p>
