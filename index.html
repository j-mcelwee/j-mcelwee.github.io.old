			<h2>
			Welcome to my personal website! <br>
			My name is James and I am an IT systems engineer with 3 years of experience in designing, implementing, and maintaining complex IT systems. 
			My passion for technology started at a young age and has only grown stronger as my career progresses.  
			I love to solve complex problems and puzzles. Recently, I've been into Sudoku. My best expert time (no hints/mistakes) is around 5 minutes. 
			Throughout my professional journey, I have developed my technical skills in areas such as network infrastructure, systems administration, cloud computing, cybersecurity, and project management.
			However, I created this page more for fun than to show off my skills. If you want to know more about those, please reach out via linkedin.
